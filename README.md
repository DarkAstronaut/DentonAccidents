# DentonAccidents

The dataset contains information about car accidents in Denton, Texas, with various columns representing different aspects of each accident, such as the crash date, time, severity, road conditions, and traffic amounts. 
The data will be explored through four labs in this course, with *Lab 1* focusing on data cleanup and preparation to ensure the dataset is properly formatted, missing values are handled, and all necessary transformations are made to facilitate further analysis in subsequent labs.

Lab 1:
- Replacing Null and incorrect values
- Transforming data to One-Hot vectors / Mapping data to levels

*Lab2* focuses on applying Clustering models on the data obtained after cleaning and transforming from previous lab.

Lab 2:
- Agglomerative Clustering
- K-Means Clustering
- Silhouette Score for both models

*Lab3* involves Correlaton and Regression

Lab3:
- Pearson's Correlaton Coefficient
- Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) models
- Linear Regression ( + SGDRegressor)
- Polynomial Regression

With *Lab4*, techniques for Classification and Prediction are applied and a Sample Accident is classified into Category based on the data

Lab4:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Algorithm
